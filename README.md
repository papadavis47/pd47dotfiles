# The Way I Like Things 🤓

This is where I store all of my present config files. The files change and evolve a lot.

Dotfiles are very personal things. No programmer works the same as other programmers. I believe most
things in life, **maybe everything is life**, is that way. No two people are alike in this world, so
it stands to reason that no programmer's workflow is going to be the same as any other programmer's
workflow. Sure, they might be similar ( _in which case all the better to steal from_ ).

# Just "DO YOU" 💯

I've learned over the years to just work the way that I want to work. Steal and be inspired by all
sorts of people - but at the end of the day, in any discipline, I have to find what works for me and
make my own methods. Maybe the best people at any given discipline are simply the ones who have
found what works for them.
