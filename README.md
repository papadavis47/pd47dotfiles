# The Way I Like Things 🤓

This is where I store all of my present config files. The files change and evolve a lot.

Dotfiles are very personal things. No programmer works the same as other programmers. No two people
are alike in this world, so it stands to reason that no programmer's workflow is going to be the
same as any other programmer's workflow. Sure, they might be similar ( _in which case all the better
to steal from_ ).

# Just "DO YOU" 💯

I've learned over the years to just work the way that I want to work. Steal and be inspired by all
sorts of people - but at the end of the day, in any discipline, I have to find what works for me and
make my own methods.

There are a "thousand different roads to Mecca". 🥋 🦁
