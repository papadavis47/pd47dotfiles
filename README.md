# The Way I Like Things - This is ME

This is where I will store all of my present and future config files. I will be changing and
evolving them a lot over time.

Dotfiles are very personal things. No programmer works the same as other programmers. The older I
get the more I believe most things in life ( maybe everything is life ) is that way. No two people
are alike in this world, so it stands to reason that no programmer's workflow is going to be the
same as any other programmer's workflow. Sure, they might be similar ( in which case all the better
to steal from ) but all of this is very personal. 

# Just "DO YOU"

I've learned over the years to just work the way that I want to work. Steal and be inspired by all
sorts of people - but at the end of the day, in any discipline - whatever the hell it is - I have to
find what works for me and make my own methods that work for me. Maybe the best people at any given
discipline are simply the ones who have found what works for them, and have created their own
processes for getting things done that work. There are a "thousand different roads to Mecca". I wish
I had trusted this instinct more over the years. 

But I am trusting it now.
